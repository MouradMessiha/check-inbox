C# project  
Purpose: Display a notification in the taskbar when a new email arrives in Microsoft Outlook. The notification that comes with Microsoft Outlook doesn't work sometimes.  
Usage: Run the program (after running Microsoft Outlook). When a new email arrives, the icon in the taskbar will change from an eye to an animation of diffrent envelopes. Click on the taskbar icon to go to Microsoft Outlook. When the emails are flagged as read in Microsoft Outlook the animated icon will change back to an icon of an eye.  
To close the program right click on the icon, a popup window will appear, click on the close button.
